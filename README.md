# 🏦 Bank Data Management Project

Welcome to the Bank Data Management Project! This assignment demonstrates my expertise in building a robust hashmap to manage millions of bank accounts efficiently. Explore the power of hash functions and collision resolution strategies in this exciting data structures project.

## Project Objectives 🚀

1. **Efficient Hashmap Implementation:**
   - Create a hashmap for swift storage and retrieval of bank account information.

2. **Hash Functions at Work:**
   - Manage vast arrays of bank accounts using powerful hash functions.

3. **Data Security is Key:**
   - Guarantee accurate storage, retrieval, and security of each account's data.

4. **Pillar of Banking Infrastructure:**
   - Act as a fundamental pillar for accessing balances, updating financial information, and validating account existence.


     ## Implemented Strategies 🛠️

1. **Chaining:**
   - Utilize `bankStorage2d` for seamless chaining strategy implementation.

2. **Linear Probing:**
   - Implement linear probing using `bankStorage1d`.

3. **Quadratic Probing:**
   - Implement quadratic probing using `bankStorage1d`.

4. **Cubic Probing:**
   - Implement cubic probing using `bankStorage1d`.

5. **Competitive Part:**
   - Experiment and implement an optimized collision resolution strategy. The power is in your hands!
