# 🏦 Bank Data Management Project

Welcome to the Bank Data Management Project! This Project demonstrates ability in building a robust hashmap to manage millions of bank accounts efficiently. Explored the power of hash functions and collision resolution strategies in this exciting data structures project.

## Project Objectives 🚀

1. **Efficient Hashmap Implementation:**
   - Created a hashmap for swift storage and retrieval of bank account information.

2. **Hash Functions at Work:**
   - Managed vast arrays of bank accounts using powerful hash functions.

3. **Data Security is Key:**
   - Guaranteed accurate storage, retrieval, and security of each account's data.

4. **Pillar of Banking Infrastructure:**
   - Act as a fundamental pillar for accessing balances, updating financial information, and validating account existence.


     ## Implemented Strategies 🛠️

1. **Chaining:**
   - Utilized `bankStorage2d` for seamless chaining strategy implementation.

2. **Linear Probing:**
   - Implemented linear probing using `bankStorage1d`.

3. **Quadratic Probing:**
   - Implemented quadratic probing using `bankStorage1d`.

4. **Cubic Probing:**
   - Implemented cubic probing using `bankStorage1d`.

5. **Competitive Part:**
   - Experimented and implemented an optimized collision resolution strategy.


## Project Structure 🌐

- **BankData class:**
  - Methods for managing bank accounts.

- **Account struct:**
  - Blueprint for a bank account.

- **Vectors:**
  - `bankStorage1d` and `bankStorage2d` for experimenting with different collision resolution strategies.
